"""Decision-voice observer — a different CLASS of LLM research call.

The primary and duelist are chat-completion models: they receive a ~4.2k-token
prose prompt and GENERATE a verdict as text, which `research.parse_verdict`
scrapes off the last line. That pipeline has a structural failure class the
duel/audit history keeps hitting: a model that emits prose without a final
JSON line is silently recorded as PASS conf 0.0 (masked verdicts), and
thinking models burn the whole token budget before any answer exists.

Decision models (Cloudflare Clef / Clef-Flash, Jev, Kev, Laya — llama.cpp
decision-model support merged 2026-10-03, PR ggml-org/llama.cpp#29831) invert
the contract: the request is a STATE (the situation, as text or JSON) plus a
SCHEMA of typed questions with a CLOSED list of allowed answers, and the
response is a probability for every allowed option of every question in ONE
forward pass. No generation, no parsing — the masked-verdict class cannot
occur by construction. Published median latency for clef-flash is ~39ms
(vs ~5s for the chat arms), so it rides the scan cycle for free.

This module is a SHADOW OBSERVER, exactly like the duelist: it answers the
same perception through the typed schema, records the verdict next to the
primary's (own JSONL + prompt_log role="decision_voice" + the analysis dict's
`decision_voice_at_entry` for the ledger join), and NEVER gates, NEVER
executes, and NEVER appears in any prompt. Accrual first; thresholds and the
promote/die decision are priced OFFLINE from the logged rows (house pattern —
see .hermes/WATCHLIST.md).

Endpoint note (verified 2026-10-07): llama.cpp serves this as
POST <root>/v1/systemone. lemonade-server's proxy does NOT forward that route
(its binary only routes /v1/chat/completions and friends), so the base URL
must point at a llama-server root directly (e.g. http://192.168.1.16:8080),
NOT at lemonade's :13305/api/v1. A server running clef serves ONLY the
systemone endpoint — text generation is unavailable on it.

Dormant by default: no endpoint/model named anywhere = zero extra calls,
zero rows, primary path byte-for-byte unchanged.

Config (agent config `llm.decision_voice`, hot read at call time — same
nested-slot pattern as primary/duelist):

    "llm": {
        "decision_voice": {
            "model": "clef-flash",          # required (else dormant)
            "max_state_chars": 12000,       # state JSON budget (optional)
            "timeout_s": 30.0               # per-call budget (optional)
        }
    }

Endpoint/key are env (like the other slots' endpoint vars, read at CALL
time): LLM_DV_BASE_URL (llama-server ROOT, e.g. http://192.168.1.16:8080),
LLM_DV_API_KEY (optional — bare llama-server needs no auth).

Persistence: append-only JSONL, path via HERMES_DV_FILE (the duel-store
pattern — an evaluation artifact, never truncated, corrupt line = one row).
