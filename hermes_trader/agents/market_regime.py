"""Per-asset-class market regime detection — feeds the market_regime risk gate.

Classifies each coin into crypto / equity / commodity, then picks the right
trend proxy:

  crypto    → BTC 4h trend (everything in crypto correlates to BTC)
  equity    → NVDA 4h trend (most-liquid HL single-stock perp; proxy for
              risk-on/off in the tradfi single-stock basket; switch via
              EQUITY_PROXY)
  commodity → the coin's own 4h trend (commodities aren't correlated to each
              other — gas, silver, copper, oil all move on their own drivers)

Trend itself is EMA20 vs EMA50 on 4h closes, with a short slope check on the
fast EMA so we don't whipsaw at the cross. Three states: 'up', 'down',
'neutral' (no strong direction → gate stays out of the way).

Regimes are cached per-proxy for `REGIME_TTL_S` (default 10 min) so the gate
doesn't re-fetch candles for every trade attempt in a scan cycle.
