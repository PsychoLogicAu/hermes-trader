"""DSL (Dynamic Stop-Loss) exit engine.

Manages exit logic for open positions with a two-phase design:

  Phase 1 — Loss protection from entry until price moves up `protect_pct`.
  Phase 2 — Profit locking with tiered retrace thresholds once PnL is positive.

Unlike a plain SL order, DSL trails upward as price rises and only exits
when the mark price breaches the computed floor.

Phase 1 (Loss protection):
  - max_loss_pct below entry → hard stop
  - protect_pct above entry → transition to Phase 2
  - min(profit_floor, entry - max_loss)

Phase 2 (Profit locking):
  - trailing floor at entry + (peak - entry) * (1 - retrace_pct)
  - retrace_pct increases with unrealized profit (tiers)
  - hard_timeout after entry → emergency exit

Usage:
    dsl = ExitPolicy(max_loss_pct=3.0, protect_pct=1.5, ...)
    verdict = dsl.check(position_entry_price, current_mark_price, entry_time)
    if verdict.exit:
        close_position(reason=verdict.reason)
