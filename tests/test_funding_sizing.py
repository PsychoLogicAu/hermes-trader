"""T2.4 — the per-trade risk budget is sized against the FUNDING account, not
aggregate equity.

Hermetic (in-memory harness, no network). Pins the upstream 729be391cac3 fix:
a trade is FUNDED by one account (main for crypto, the specific HIP-3 dex for
colon coins), so the per-trade risk budget — the primary-stop equal-risk branch
and the ATR sizer — must use THAT account's equity (`size_equity`, = the
per-`_target_dex` equity), NOT the aggregate. Sizing on aggregate over-sizes
vs the balance that actually funds the trade, so the funding account saturates
after 1-2 trades and every other mover is margin-blocked. `agg_equity` stays on
the aggregate exposure / gross caps and the daily PnL / kill threshold.
