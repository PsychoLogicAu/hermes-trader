"""P3 — band_snapback.shadow_mode (the single umbrella flag).

Adds ONE new config key `band_snapback.shadow_mode` (code default FALSE =
current behavior, so the merge is a no-op). When TRUE (with `enabled` still
TRUE), every band-snapback action point becomes LOG-ONLY while the trigger
keeps computing:

  1. research.py prompt block — the fired branch AND the "band trending"
     context branch render NOTHING (snapback_block -> empty).
  2. perception.py snapback_bypass — additionally requires NOT shadow_mode.
  3. risk_gates.py band_counter_breach_gate — the shadow decision ORs in the
     umbrella so the gate goes would-block-only even with its own
     shadow_mode at default. (Covered in test_band_counter_breach_gate.py.)
  4. perception.py accrual line — on every FIRED snapback while shadow_mode,
     emit exactly one `[band-snapback][SHADOW] {coin} {side} — {reason}
     (shadow: prompt+surfacing suppressed, gate log-only)` line; silent when
     shadow_mode is false.
  5. trigger keeps computing — `fired`/`reason` keep populating regardless of
     shadow_mode.

All hermetic: no network, no LLM, no candle fetch, no model. Config is
written to the temp file the test suite is isolated on (config_store.CONFIG_PATH)
for the prompt path and passed directly to `_scan_single_market` for the
perception path.
