# Exit Engine — DSL trail + server-side brackets

Every executed position gets three exit layers, all set at entry. Originally the
fix set for the **"we had it all and gave it back"** round-trips; materially
re-tuned 2026-06-16 (see "Scalp vs trend-ride" below) and tightened again in the
2026-06-18 PnL audit.

## 1. DSL trailing stop (`hermes_trader/agents/dsl_exit.py`) — primary, 60s tick

- **Phase 1 (loss):** exit at `min(max_loss_pct, max_loss_roe_pct / lev)`. Current
  live new-entry config: `max_loss_pct=0.4` spot, `max_loss_roe_pct=3.0`. **The
  ROE cap usually binds** — at 12x that is 0.25% spot; at 9x, 0.33%. This is
  intentionally a fast invalidation stop for the current runner/scalp profile.
- **Phase 2 (profit lock):** arms at `protect_pct`. Floor = `entry ± peak_range ×
  (1 − retrace)`, ratchets one-way (never gives back).
- **Retrace ladder (`phase2_tiers`)** = the give-back control; tighter = bank faster.
  Wired from config in BOTH builders (`executor.py` entry-time `ExitPolicy(...)` +
  `dsl_exit._policy_from_config`). Hot-read for new entries.

## Scalp vs trend-ride — the 2026-06-16 finding (the exit lever)

Controlled backtest (`scripts/reentry_backtest.py`, same lev/coins/period, only
exit params vary):
```
scalp      (protect 1.5 / retrace 0.30):  61% win  +$1518   <- 2026-06-16 live baseline
trend-ride (protect 3.0 / retrace 0.55):  47% win  -$757
```
**Tight (scalp) beats loose (trend-ride) hard in chop** — loose lets winners give
it all back. Current live new-entry config keeps the scalp profile but uses the
latest audit's values: `protect_pct=1.25`, `retrace_threshold=0.20`,
`phase2_tiers=[{8.0,0.35},{15.0,0.40}]`. Trend-ride was originally shipped after
validating on ONE up-trend day — it rides rippers but bleeds in chop, the dominant
regime. Caveat: scalp can amputate the fat-tail winners the edge depends on —
`tp_scale_fraction` lets a runner ride (below).

- **`regime_aware {enabled, scope, trend_ride{…}}`** (default OFF): when
  `detect_regime()=='up'`, swaps to looser trend-ride params (scalp chop / ride
  trends). Backtested BELOW always-scalp in the chop sample → gated off; enable
  only once a sustained-trend sample validates it (restart to load code, then flip).
  `scope` (B.27, 2026-09-21): `"late_chase"` restricts trend_ride to entries that got
  in via the late-chase bypass (`analysis["_entry_class"]`, set only on a LIVE bypass;
  absent/`"all"` = book-wide as before; unknown value fails safe to scalp). The policy
  is chosen ONCE at open and lives on the tracker — flipping scope mid-life never
  re-tunes an open position. Scope A/B (§B.27): late-chase+up is the good trend_ride
  population; regime-up-wide is tail-carried (top-5 = 172% of net).
- **Hard timeout / stale-flat:** `hard_timeout_minutes` (1800); and
  `stale_flat_timeout_minutes` (480) flattens a position that never reaches
  `protect_pct`.

## 2. Backup stop-loss trigger (server-side)

`place_hl_trigger_order(is_buy, size, sl_px, "sl", coin)` at `sl_atr_mult`=1.5 ATR,
placed at entry. Fires on the exchange between 60s ticks — the ONLY protection
while the host sleeps or the loop restarts. `[executor] Backup SL FAILED` =
escalate (position has no server-side stop).

## 3. Take-profit scale-out (server-side) — keeps the right tail

`tp_scale_fraction` (0.5) of the position gets a reduce-only TP trigger at
`TP_ATR_MULT`=1 ATR past entry. Banks half at target; the rest rides the DSL
trail. This is what stops scalp from fully amputating the fat tail — verify it's
firing (`Placed TP scale-out` log). HL accepts a 100%-SL + 50%-TP reduce-only
bracket without "would increase position" rejects.

## Trigger hygiene

`close_position_market` calls `cancel_open_orders_for_coin(coin)` after a market
close to clear the stranded SL/TP bracket, else stale reduce-only orders pile up
and reject later reduce-only orders (`reduce only order would increase position`).

## Execution-quality capture (2026-06-16)

Each close logs `entry_slip_bps`/`exit_slip_bps` (fill vs arrival mid),
`funding_cost_usd`, `hold_minutes`, `regime_at_entry`, `is_hip3` → the cost data
the backtests omit. Thin HIP-3 books slip materially (xyz median ~12.5 vs crypto
~5 bps); at n≥50 build a per-coin slippage kill-list (>~50bps).
